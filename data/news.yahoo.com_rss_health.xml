Josh Shaw, a senior defensive back and team captain, said he suffered two high ankle sprains on Saturday after leaping from a second-floor balcony at an apartment complex in Palmdale, California, to help a 7-year-old nephew who was distressed in a swimming pool. "Within the last few hours or so, we've gotten a few phone calls contradicting what Josh said occurred Saturday night, so we're going to continue to vet," Sarkisian told reporters. Shaw, 22, has been hailed by the university and media for his heroism after his story was published on the USC football team's website on Monday.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/usc-vet-football-players-rescue-story-doubts-coach-003224296--nfl.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 20:32:24 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">usc-vet-football-players-rescue-story-doubts-coach-003224296--nfl</guid></item><item><title>Some HealthCare.gov contractors see contract values rise: report</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/healthcare-gov-contractors-see-contract-values-rise-report-002120180--sector.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/as1FkbQNgARRjRkkqoWrTQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-08-27T002120Z_1_LYNXMPEA7Q00B_RTROPTP_2_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="A man looks over the Affordable Care Act signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York in this photo illustration" align="left" title="A man looks over the Affordable Care Act signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York in this photo illustration" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three firms involved in the troubled Obamacare website HealthCare.gov have seen their contract values exceed initial estimates by more than a quarter-billion dollars, including the lead IT contractor at the time of the site&amp;#039;s botched rollout, government data shows.

Seaman NEW YORK (Reuters Health) – The introduction of robotic surgery for prostate cancer may have led to changes in the number of surgeons performing prostate removals and in the overall cost, according to a new study. With the technology being used more widely, fewer doctors are performing the procedure and the overall cost of prostate removal has gone up, researchers found. While studies examining the benefits and potential harms of robotic surgery have produced mixed results, the researchers write in BJU International that there is little information on how the innovation influenced prostate removal in the U.S. "We knew by anecdotal reports as well as the scientific literature that it had become relatively widespread but we didn’t know how that had been done,” said Dr. Steven Chang, the study’s lead author from Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/robotic-prostate-removal-tied-surgical-changes-costs-214648736--finance.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 17:46:48 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">robotic-prostate-removal-tied-surgical-changes-costs-214648736--finance</guid></item><item><title>Twitter helps Chicago find sources of food poisoning</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/twitter-helps-chicago-sources-food-poisoning-210826156.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/0IhhyF4xeKUr6yAYPd8sTg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-08-26T210826Z_1_LYNXMPEA7P109_RTROPTP_2_TWITTER-IPO.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in Warsaw" align="left" title="People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in Warsaw" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Shereen Lehman NEW YORK (Reuters Health) – When Chicago health officials saw Twitter users complaining about local food poisoning episodes, they reached out on Twitter to those users and often ended up charging the restaurant in question with a violation. “We know that the majority of cases of foodborne outbreaks really never end up getting reported to the local health department anywhere in the country,” Dr. Bechara Choucair told Reuters Health in a phone call. “We realize the people might not pick up the phone and call the doctor, but they might go to Twitter and complain to the world that they got food poisoning from eating out,” he said.

In a blog post, the agency said researchers at North Carolina A&amp;T State University have found a way to reduce peanut allergens by 98 percent to 100 percent by focusing on certain proteins that can trigger food-related anaphylaxis, a severe, whole-body allergic reaction. "We found that treating peanuts with protein-breaking enzymes reduced allergenic proteins," said Dr. Jianmai Yu, a food and nutrition researcher at NC A&amp;T’s School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/u-says-non-allergic-peanut-closer-commercial-reality-192057889--sector.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 16:48:43 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">u-says-non-allergic-peanut-closer-commercial-reality-192057889--sector</guid></item><item><title>Obama tells veterans better mental health care on the way</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/obama-plans-executive-steps-boost-veterans-mental-health-104440219.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/655oIkOzrMLldlbtijTkdQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-08-26T202918Z_3_LYNXMPEA7P0IR_RTROPTP_2_USA-MISSOURI-SHOOTING-OBAMA.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="U.S. President Obama speaks about developments in Iraq and civil unrest in Missouri, from the White House in Washington" align="left" title="U.S. President Obama speaks about developments in Iraq and civil unrest in Missouri, from the White House in Washington" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Mark Felsenthal CHARLOTTE N.C.

In a long-awaited report that will be debated by member states at a meeting in October in Moscow, the United Nations health agency on Tuesday also voiced concern about the concentration of the $3 billion market in the hands of big tobacco companies. "In a nutshell, the WHO report shows that e-cigarettes and similar devices pose threats to public health," Douglas Bettcher, director of the agency's department on non-communicable diseases, told a news briefing in Geneva. Because they are so new, there is a lack of long-term scientific evidence to support their safety, and some fear they could lead to nicotine addiction and tobacco smoking.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/urges-regulatory-curbs-e-cigarettes-091428397.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 15:58:55 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">urges-regulatory-curbs-e-cigarettes-091428397</guid></item><item><title>Ebola has 'upper hand' says US health official</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/liberian-ministers-defied-ebola-order-fired-095558467.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/2eXtN0k3TIVQoHznukYhxg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/9cc4f5d063c7d3215d0f6a706700f5b6.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="Graphic provides an update on the spread of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa." align="left" title="Graphic provides an update on the spread of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa." border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — Ebola still has the &amp;quot;upper hand&amp;quot; in the outbreak that has killed more than 1,400 people in West Africa, but experts have the means to stop it, a top American health official said during a visit to the hardest-hit countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/liberian-ministers-defied-ebola-order-fired-095558467.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 15:42:08 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</source><guid isPermaLink="false">liberian-ministers-defied-ebola-order-fired-095558467</guid><media:content url="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/2eXtN0k3TIVQoHznukYhxg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/9cc4f5d063c7d3215d0f6a706700f5b6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="130" height="86"></media:content><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/liberian-ministers-defied-ebola-order-fired-095558467.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/2eXtN0k3TIVQoHznukYhxg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/9cc4f5d063c7d3215d0f6a706700f5b6.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="Graphic provides an update on the spread of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa." align="left" title="Graphic provides an update on the spread of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa." border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — Ebola still has the &amp;quot;upper hand&amp;quot; in the outbreak that has killed more than 1,400 people in West Africa, but experts have the means to stop it, a top American health official said during a visit to the hardest-hit countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"></media:credit></item><item><title>Lokai: Balancing Life (#ArtofY)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-schattner/lokai-balancing-life-arto_b_5686719.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/vZAhXRNN0kkeNbmPX0z4xA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/huffingtonpost.com.rss/e54f75d802bd8a4126b8dc3bc937f632" width="130" height="86" alt="Lokai: Balancing Life (#ArtofY)" align="left" title="Lokai: Balancing Life (#ArtofY)" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;You have to stay hopefully in the low times, and humble in the high times?&amp;quot; Those are the words on which Steven Izen, 23, founded Lokai in 2013.

In a move that administration officials billed as an effort to bring new accountability to the federal operation, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced that Kevin Counihan would oversee federal operations, as well as health insurance regulation, in the new post of marketplace chief executive officer.

Zhang and his team examined height and weight data on 2,871 children, ages six to 11, from the 1988 to 1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and 3,202 similar kids from the 2005 to 2010 cycles of the survey. In all cases, the children’s parents were asked if they considered their child ‘overweight, underweight, just about the right weight, or don’t know.’ In the 1988 to 1994 data set, 78 percent of parents of an overweight boy and 61 percent of parents of an overweight girl, identified the child as ‘about the right weight.’ That number increased to 83 percent for boys and 78 percent for girls in the 2005 to 2010 period.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/more-parents-think-overweight-child-175049163.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 13:50:49 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">more-parents-think-overweight-child-175049163</guid></item><item><title>Medicaid payouts for office visits may influence cancer screening: study</title><description>By Kathryn Doyle NEW YORK (Reuters Health) – In states where Medicaid pays doctors higher fees for office visits, Medicaid beneficiaries are more likely to be screened for breast, cervical or colorectal cancer, according to a new study. “States tend to vary in their reimbursement rates for different types of medical care services; Each state establishes its own coverage and reimbursement policies.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/medicaid-payouts-office-visits-may-influence-cancer-screening-173045274.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 13:30:45 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">medicaid-payouts-office-visits-may-influence-cancer-screening-173045274</guid></item><item><title>Building a Community of Creative Collaborators</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barry-segal/building-a-community-of-c_b_5716893.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/WInx_RB.7b7QRhiVWZq.jQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3B4b2ZmPTUwO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT03NTt3PTEzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/huffingtonpost.com.rss/b9ff63957bfe21bd03dbf5253b9db7b7" width="130" height="86" alt="Building a Community of Creative Collaborators" align="left" title="Building a Community of Creative Collaborators" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a guest post by Martin Segal, Managing Director, Segal Family Foundation (SFF).
